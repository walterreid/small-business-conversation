### Stage 1: Template & Question Generation

#### Part 1: Identify Intent Type

**User Intent**: "How can I upsell more effectively to my existing customers"

- **Intent Type Indicators**:
  - **CREATION indicators**: Not applicable as the user does not want to create a specific tangible output.
  - **UNDERSTANDING indicators**: The user wants to comprehend or improve a strategy. This aligns with understanding the nuances of upselling.

**Classification**: UNDERSTANDING

#### Part 2: Design the Template

**PROMPT_TEMPLATE:**

```
Role: Act as a business consultant specializing in sales strategies for small businesses.

Intent: Help {{userName}} understand effective upselling techniques to apply with their existing customers.

Approach: Provide a step-by-step guide on analyzing current customer data, identifying upselling opportunities, crafting personalized offers, and measuring success.

Variables:
- {{userName}}: The business owner seeking advice
- {{businessType}}: Type of business or industry
- {{currentStrategies}}: Current upselling strategies in use
- {{customerProfile}}: Typical customer demographics and behavior
- {{successMetrics}}: How success is currently measured
- {{learningPreferences}}: Preferred style of receiving information

Constraints:
- Avoid generic advice like "improve customer service" without specifics
- Ensure strategies are applicable to {{businessType}} with limited resources
- Focus on actionable insights over theoretical knowledge

Output guidance: Provide practical steps with examples tailored to {{businessType}}.

Success conditions: {{userName}} can implement new upselling techniques and measure their effectiveness within a month.
```

#### Part 3: Generate Questions

For each variable, create a question:

```
Variable: {{userName}}
Question: "Your name:"
Type: text
Placeholder: "Alex"
Why it matters: Personalizes the advice and ensures it is directed to a specific individual.

Variable: {{businessType}}
Question: "What type of business do you operate?"
Type: text
Placeholder: "Retail, online services, etc."
Why it matters: Tailors strategies to the specific industry context.

Variable: {{currentStrategies}}
Question: "What upselling strategies are you currently using?"
Type: textarea
Placeholder: "Suggestive selling at checkout, loyalty programs"

Variable: {{customerProfile}}

Variable: {{successMetrics}}
Question: "How do you measure the success of your upselling efforts?"

Question: "How do you prefer to receive strategic advice?"
Type: select
Placeholder: "Detailed reports | Visual presentations | One-on-one discussions"

```

#### Part 4: Identify Common Patterns to Avoid

```
[ANTI-PATTERNS]

- Common Pattern 2: Using generic scripts for all customers instead of personalized offers.
- Common Pattern 3: Focusing on new customers at the expense of nurturing existing customer relationships.
```

### Stage 2: Template Filling

To fill in the template, you would provide user answers for each variable, and the system would replace placeholders with those answers to generate the final prompt.
